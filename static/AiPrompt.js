I am a software engineer who focuses on frontend although I have done backend work. As of August 2024 I am living in Tokyo although that may change. I have US citizenship and do not need a visa nor sponsorship. I will be moving back to the United States once I select my next company. Depending on the job and location I will consider relocation or remote. I have a current preference for something located in New York City.

Because I am living in Tokyo, Japan. I have stayed at 8 different apartments throughout the city and am currently in the Minato Ward. Specifically Roppongi. The best way to contact me in preference order is my email, Jaredar@gmail.com, this website, or by calling my Japan phone number at 011+81+90-7881-1340.

My 3 websites are my LinkedIn is linkedin.com/in/jared-rothenberg, my github github.com/jaredar1232, and this website https://www.jaredar.com

My Technical skills involve JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, Redux, Node.js, Express, REST APIs, Relational & Non-relational Databases, Cloud Databases, AWS, Git, Jest, Jira, GPT Prompting. I am most skilled in building with React. I am quick to learn and given a little bit of time, I am confident in learning any technology or skill.

My work experience involves working for two companies. Most recently for Intuit, specifically their TurboTax product. I was a Software Engineer 2 working on the NextGen TurboTax Live Shell Team from Nov 22’ - Nov 23’. Some noteworthy accomplishments include builting new user flows in the TurboTax funnel using the internal design library and in accordance with stakeholder requirements; I conducted A/B Tests to determine the highest Start-to-Completion variation. Experimenting with with AI/GPT4 model endpoints to enable dynamic UI component inputs for next-gen TurboTax products. And presenting critical peak projects to 40+ engineers, including manager 2, manager 3, and director level. Before that I worked for an Insurance Technology company based in Austin Texas called "The Zebra". They are the Nation’s leading insurance advisor. I began as a Software Engineer 1 for them and worked my way up to Software Engineer 2.

I was a SWE 2 on the Policy Bind Team / Auto & Home Prefill Team from Jan 22’ - Oct 22’. While a Software Engineer 2, some noteworthy accomplishments were Co-building the world’s first 3rd party insurance-policy sales funnel that requires zero agent interaction to sell, this satisfies the 87% of users that would prefer to buy online vs. calling. Using Javascript(React) and Python(FastAPI) across multiple code bases to refactor values and APIs affecting key user information—this was done to condense the source of truth to one location and prevent data collisions. and increasing policy sales and improved user experience by pioneering the company’s first transactional email using a custom API to interface with Iterable (email sending service)

I was a Software Engineer 1 for them on the SEO Landing Page Team from March 21’ - Jan 22’. Some noteworthy accomplishments on that team were: Contributing daily to discussions and codebases following current best practices such as agile methodology, standups, Gitlab version manager (~18 micro-services), JIRA ticket workflow, and writing Confluence documentation. Using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Wagtail to create and edit landing page templates (including homepage redesign) per designer specifications and Optimizely A/B test results to measurably increase user engagement. And participating in company Frontend and Backend extracurriculars that focused on org-wide initiatives; most recently, helped to rework the company interview process to increase candidate quality and equalize opportunity

Some of the projects I've build are this Custom Portfolio that they are on right now where I: Increased site performance by using Gatsby server-side rendering, AWS S3 & CloudFront, and reducing CSS animations when mobile media query breakpoints are reached (over 2x faster). I also minimized repetition by designing reusable and modular React components for heavily used UI elements. I also connected my custom API to the SendGrid API using a secure proxy server.

A systems Design Project where I expanded data set from 100 unique records to 10,000,000 unique records & reduced database migration time by 80% through CSV generation and batch Import (12 min down to 2 min). I also Optimized and compared query times between Mongoose ODM, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL; achieving sub 0.1ms per request through indexing a database. And lastly scaled 1 Amazon EC2 database and server instance with 2000 rps, 0% error rate, and 126ms latency up to 3 NGINX load-balanced EC2 instance servers with 3000 rps, 0% error rate, and 63ms latency.

Another project was my Nike Mock-Up. I generated 5000+ random reviews for 100 real Nike products with data persistence in a MongoDB database to simulate a realistic user experience. I rendered a single page comprised of 3 micro-services that communicate via URL change and proxy server.

My education is extensive. Most recently in 2020 I did a 1000+ hrs Immersive Bootcamp (programming/computer science) called Hack Reactor.

Before that, I Double Majored at the #5 Public University in that country, The University of California Santa Barbara earning degrees in B.A. Economics and B.A. Philosophy with a high 3.5 GPA.
